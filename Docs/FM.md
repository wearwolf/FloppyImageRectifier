# FM Encoding

FM, or Frequency Encoding, is a method of storing information on magnetic media

Information is stored on magnetic media using changes in the polarity of the magnetic substance, these are known as flux transitions.
A flux transition encodes a binary 1 while a 0 is encoded by the lack of a flux transition.

FM Encoding inserts a flux transition as a clock bit between each data bit. This allows for easy timing synchronization but limits the 
amount of information that can be stored because there is a physical limit for how close two flux transitions can be to
each other.
